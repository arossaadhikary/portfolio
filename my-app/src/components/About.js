                        <p>
                            My name is Arossa - I'm an ambitious, goal-oriented, 2nd-year undergraduate honors student at the University of Florida (UF). I strive to use my coding knowledge to make a social impact, with a specific interest in <span className = "highlight">public service, protecting digital infrastructure, & education</span>.
                            I gravitate towards activities involving STEM education & mentorship, specifically for women & the youth. I'm aligning my career with artificial intelligence in the cybersecurity domain by studying for my Security+ certification & completing the Google Cybersecurity Certification Program with WiCYS.
